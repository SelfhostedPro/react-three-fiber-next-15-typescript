# react-three-fiber next 15 + typescript + extend

## Getting Started
Look at 
[BentPlaneGeometry.tsx](/src/components/3d/geometry/BentPlaneGeometry.tsx), 
[MeshSineMaterial.tsx](/src/components/3d/materials/MeshSineMaterial.tsx), 
and [Card.tsx](/src/components/3d/Card.tsx) to see how to extend things.

Make sure to install `"@react-three/fiber": "^9.0.0-rc.1",` in order to have proper compatibility with next 15
